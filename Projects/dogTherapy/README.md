# Dog Therapy

Project Prerequisites
The following project will rely upon:

The syntax we have learned in all the JavaScript lessons up to this point. If there is a concept in the tutorial that you don't understand, eg functions, you will want to go back and review the functions section to familiarize yourself.

Basic HTML & CSS. While this course does not intend to teach HTML & CSS if you need a refresher you can check out the section on how to create a portfolio page to brush up on the basics.

The previous project "Quote Machine". We will be teaching similar content. It's helpful to build multiple projects using similar technology to get comfortable with using the tools. This project along with "Quote Machine" introduce the fetch() method and promises in JavaScript.

## Dog Therapy Preview

In this section we are going to work with the Dog CEO API. You can find this by going to https://dog.ceo/dog-api/

If you are unfamiliar with what an API is then you might want to walk through the previous project "Quote Machine". In that project, we practice interacting with the Donald Trump Quotes API to grab quotes from a database.

I will repeat some of the content but if you start to get lost on this project you may want to refer back to that one to focus on the fundamentals.

In this project, we are going to build a little dog therapy app.

Some studies suggest that interactions with therapy animals can decrease stress in humans. Playing with or petting an animal can increase levels of the stress-reducing hormone oxytocin and decrease the production of the stress hormone cortisol.

So we are going to build a little app that you can open up any time and click a button and you will get a new image of a dog.

What if you don't like dogs?

That's ok, the point of this project is to learn how to interact with an API! As you become more comfortable with how to do this you can hit API endpoints to find information about products, movies, food and much more!

It is a crucial skill of a front-end engineer to know how to query API's for information then provide that information to people using your website.

So let's get started!
